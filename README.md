> Run different agent profiles side by side without breaking sessions that are already open.

`aweswitch` reads profiles from `~/.config/aweswitch/config.json` and offers two modes:

- **Launch mode** (`aweswitch <profile>`) — starts a new agent session with isolated env. Each session gets its own API endpoint, token, and model. Different terminals can run different profiles simultaneously. Env is frozen at launch time.
- **Write mode** (`aweswitch apply <profile>`) — makes a profile the agent's persistent default: Claude env into `~/.claude/settings.json`, Codex provider+model into `~/.codex/config.toml`, OpenCode provider+models into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, and zcode providers+models into `~/.zcode/v2/config.json`. `aweswitch apply --opencode` and `aweswitch apply --zcode` apply every profile for that agent. Claude and Codex keep one active default at a time.

It is intentionally small. Today it supports Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and zcode profiles, plus official-login accounts (Claude Code / Codex OAuth).

## Support Tools

aweswitch is powered by three companion tools:

- **[aweskill](https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweskill)** — CLI skill package manager for AI agents. Handles skill installation, updates, and projection across 47+ coding agents.
- **[aweshelf](https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweshelf)** — Session bookmark manager for Claude Code and Codex. Bookmark, categorize, and restore sessions with aweswitch profiles.
- **[awerouter](https://github.com/mugpeng/awerouter)** — Smart LLM router: routes agent requests to flash (cheap) or pro (strong) providers based on structural signals.

aweswitch manages how you **launch** sessions; aweshelf manages how you **remember** them. Use `aweswitch -c` to auto-bookmark at launch, and `aweshelf resume` to restore with the same profile later. And awerouter pairs just as smoothly: point a profile's `BASE_URL` at the awerouter daemon (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL=auto`), and every session you launch goes through its flash/pro routing.

## Install & Usage

### Let AI agent install and configure

If you are working in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or other coding agents, tell it:

```text
Read https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweswitch/blob/main/README.ai.md and follow it to install and configure aweswitch.
```

The agent will install the `aweswitch` CLI, set up config, and help you add profiles. For ongoing profile management, it can also install the aweswitch skill via [aweskill](https://aweskill.webioinfo.top/).

**After setup, you can tell the agent things like:**

> "Write cc-glm to settings so I can switch with /model."
> "List all aweswitch profiles."
> "Add an AiHubMix codex profile."
> "Change the model in cc-glm to glm-5.2."

The agent can run `aweswitch apply`, `aweswitch config backup`, and `aweswitch config restore` directly, but will not run `aweswitch <profile>` (launch mode) — that would nest agents. To launch a profile, run it in your own terminal:

```bash
aweswitch cc-glm
```

</details>

### Manual install and usage

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install aweswitch
aweswitch --help
```

Create the default config:

```bash
aweswitch config init
```

Then open the config and align it with your real providers, models, and token variable names:

```bash
aweswitch config edit
```

Or add a new profile interactively:

```bash
aweswitch add
```

This prompts for a type — `api` (provider, profile name, and provider-specific fields) or `official` (interactive OAuth login / import of a Claude Code or Codex official account).

The default config shape splits profiles by kind (`api` for env-based API profiles, `accounts` for official logins) and then by provider. This is a reference config you can adapt:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "api": {
      "claude": {
        "cc-glm": {
          "env": {
            "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic",
            "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "${GLM_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN}",
            "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "glm-5.1"
          }
        },
        "cc-xiaomi": {
          "env": {
            "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://token-plan-sgp.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic",
            "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "${XIAOMI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN}",
            "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "mimo-v2.5-pro"
          }
        }
      },
      "codex": {
        "cx-openai": {
          "env": {
            "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "https://api.openai.com",
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
          }
        }
      },
      "opencode": {
        "oc-glm": {
          "env": {
            "OPENCODE_BASE_URL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4",
            "OPENCODE_API_KEY": "${GLM_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN}",
            "OPENCODE_NAME": "Zhipu GLM",
            "OPENCODE_MODEL": {
              "glm-5.1": "GLM-5.1",
              "glm-5.2": "GLM-5.2"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "zcode": {
        "zc-glm": {
          "env": {
            "ZCODE_BASE_URL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4",
            "ZCODE_API_KEY": "${GLM_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN}",
            "ZCODE_NAME": "BigModel - Coding Plan",
            "ZCODE_CHAT_MODEL": {
              "GLM-5.3-Flash": "GLM-5.3-Flash",
              "GLM-5-Turbo": "GLM-5-Turbo"
            }
          }
        }
      }
        }
      }
    },
    "accounts": {}
  }
}
```

Configs from before v0.4 (profiles grouped directly by provider) are migrated automatically on first load, with a `config.json.bak` backup written next to the config.

Configure the token variables referenced by your profiles:

```bash
# Claude / OpenCode profiles
export GLM_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
export XIAOMI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="..."

# Codex profiles
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."

# zcode profiles
export ZCODE_API_KEY="..."
```

Put long-lived variables in your shell config file if you want them available in every shell — `~/.zshrc` on macOS, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` on bash, or `$PROFILE` on PowerShell.

Verify the configured profiles:

```bash
aweswitch list
aweswitch show cc-glm
```

Run a profile:

```bash
aweswitch cc-glm                      # Claude Code
aweswitch cx-openai                   # Codex
aweswitch oc-glm                      # OpenCode (default: first model)
aweswitch oc-glm glm-5.2              # OpenCode (specific model)
aweswitch cxo-work                    # Codex official account (see below)
```

Pass extra arguments through to the agent:

```bash
aweswitch cc-glm --dangerously-skip-permissions
aweswitch cx-openai --model o3
aweswitch oc-glm glm-5.1 --mini
```

Auto-bookmark sessions with [aweshelf](https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweshelf):

```bash
aweswitch cc-glm -c backend -t "Fix auth bug"
```

See [aweshelf Integration](#aweshelf-integration) for details.

Useful config commands:

```bash
aweswitch config path
aweswitch config show
aweswitch config edit
```

#### aweswitch skill

Install the [aweswitch skill](https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweswitch/blob/main/resources/skills/aweswitch/SKILL.md) via [aweskill](https://aweskill.webioinfo.top/) to let AI agents manage profiles with natural language:

- List, inspect, add, edit, and delete profiles
- Apply profiles to settings (`aweswitch apply`) or restore from backup (`aweswitch config restore`)
- Guide environment variable setup (e.g. adding tokens to `~/.zshrc` on macOS, `~/.bashrc` on bash, or `$PROFILE` on PowerShell)

After install, you can tell the agent things like "Add an AiHubMix codex profile", "Change the model in cc-glm to glm-5.2", or "List all profiles". The agent reads the config, makes changes, and verifies the result.

#### Launch mode — isolated sessions

Each invocation starts a new agent session with its own env. Different terminals can run different profiles at the same time.

```bash
aweswitch cc-glm                      # launch Claude Code profile
aweswitch cx-openai                   # launch Codex profile
aweswitch cc-glm --dangerously-skip-permissions   # pass extra arguments
aweswitch cc-glm -c backend -t "Fix auth bug"     # auto-bookmark with aweshelf
```

#### Write mode — persistent defaults

`aweswitch apply` writes a profile into the agent's own config so it becomes the persistent default:

```bash
aweswitch apply cc-glm                # Claude: env -> ~/.claude/settings.json
aweswitch apply cx-glm                # Codex: provider+model -> ~/.codex/config.toml
  aweswitch apply oc-glm                # OpenCode: provider+models -> ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
  aweswitch apply zc-glm                # zcode: provider+models -> ~/.zcode/v2/config.json
  aweswitch apply --opencode            # all OpenCode profiles at once (bulk only makes sense there)
  aweswitch apply --zcode               # all zcode profiles at once
aweswitch apply --opencode --prune orphans   # apply all and remove tracked providers no profile backs
aweswitch apply --opencode --prune all       # also remove every provider no profile backs (hand-written included)
aweswitch apply --opencode --prune old-a,old-b --dry-run  # preview named removals, write nothing
aweswitch apply cc-glm cx-glm oc-glm  # mixed: one per agent in a single call
aweswitch apply cc-glm --force        # overwrite existing backup
aweswitch config backup               # back up Claude settings on demand and print the backup path
aweswitch config restore              # restore settings from default backup
aweswitch config restore <file>       # restore settings from an explicit backup file
```

Per-agent semantics:

- **Claude** — env is merged into `~/.claude/settings.json`; unrelated settings are preserved, while a stale `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` alternative is removed when the new profile does not declare it. Restart the session or use `/model` to pick the new model.
- **Codex** — the provider table and default model are written into `~/.codex/config.toml` (existing content like `mcp_servers` is preserved; first apply creates a `.toml.bak` backup). The API key stays in the environment: `env_key` points at the `${VAR_NAME}` the profile references, so codex reads the key from your shell.
- **OpenCode** — the provider entry (base URL, key ref, display name) and its **full model list** are upserted into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`: overwritten if the provider exists, added if missing. Launching a profile only adds the launched model; apply pushes everything. aweswitch records managed provider keys in `.aweswitch-managed-providers.json`; after a tracked profile is renamed or deleted, apply warns about the orphan (old sessions are pinned to those model IDs), and `aweswitch apply --opencode --prune orphans` removes it. Ownership for that mode is never inferred from configuration shape, so hand-written entries stay put unless you opt in: `--prune old-a,old-b` removes exactly the named entries (they must exist and must not be profile-backed), `--prune all` removes every provider no profile backs — full alignment, hand-written ones included; `--prune orphans` removes only tracked leftovers. Pruning refuses to run when the config has no OpenCode profiles at all. A prune never leaves the file's top-level `model` dangling: if the provider it points at was deleted, it is repointed to the alphabetically-first profile's first configured model. `--dry-run` previews the sync and prune plan without writing anything. Model IDs that contain a `/` (e.g. `hub/seed-evolving`) are displayed with the full ID in the model picker, keeping entries from different producers distinguishable.
- **zcode** — the provider entry (base URL, env key reference, display name) and its **full model list** are upserted into `~/.zcode/v2/config.json`. zcode supports exactly one API format per provider, so a profile takes `ZCODE_CHAT_MODEL` (chat completions, provider `kind: openai-compatible`) **or** `ZCODE_RESPONSES_MODEL` (Responses API, provider `kind: openai`) — never both; split them into two profiles instead. zcode is a desktop GUI app, so zcode profiles are apply-only and do not support launch mode. `--zcode` syncs every zcode profile; managed providers are tracked in `.aweswitch-managed-providers.json`, with orphan warnings by default and opt-in cleanup via `--prune` (`orphans`, `all`, or names).

Claude and Codex keep a single active default, so at most one profile of each may be applied per call. OpenCode and zcode profiles coexist side by side, so several can be applied at once — or all of them with `--opencode` / `--zcode`.

#### When to use which mode

| Scenario | Mode |
|---|---|
| Run multiple profiles side by side | Launch |
| Switch model with `/model` inside a session | Write |
| Quickly try different APIs | Launch |
| Set a persistent default profile | Write |
| Push edited OpenCode profiles into opencode.json | Write (`aweswitch apply`) |
| Push edited zcode profiles into zcode config.json | Write (`aweswitch apply`) |

> **Note:** The two modes do not interfere with each other. `aweswitch cc-glm` does not read or modify settings.json. `aweswitch apply cc-glm` does not affect running sessions.

#### Config management

```bash
aweswitch add                         # add a profile or official account interactively
aweswitch list                        # list all profiles (api + account kinds)
aweswitch show cc-glm                 # inspect one profile (secrets redacted)
aweswitch config show                 # full config (secrets redacted)
aweswitch config edit                 # open config in editor
```

#### Official accounts — multiple Claude Code / Codex logins

Official-login accounts (OAuth) are saved as accounts and launched through a private per-account config dir, so several official accounts can run side by side without touching your global `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`:

```bash
aweswitch account login codex work    # run codex login and capture it as account "work"
aweswitch account add claude team-a   # import the currently logged-in claude account
aweswitch cxo-work                    # launch codex with the "work" account
aweswitch account sync codex work     # copy refreshed tokens back into the config
aweswitch account remove codex work --purge
```

`aweswitch add` → type `official` is the interactive route to the same two flows: it asks for provider, account name, and method (`login` runs the OAuth flow, `import` reads the current CLI login).

How it works:

- Launching an account sets `CODEX_HOME` (codex) or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` + `CLAUDE_CODE_DONT_USE_KEYCHAIN=1` (claude) to a private dir under `~/.config/aweswitch/accounts/<provider>/<name>/`. Credentials are opaque blobs stored in `config.json` and masked in `show` / `config show`; the config file is chmod 600 once it contains an account.
- The account dir is the source of truth once it exists — the CLI refreshes OAuth tokens there, and an existing credentials file is never overwritten by the stored blob. Run `aweswitch account sync` to refresh the config copy for backup/portability.
- On macOS, Claude Code keeps its login in the Keychain by default; `account login` / launches force file-based credentials inside the account dir so accounts stay isolated. `account add` reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and only works when that file exists — prefer `account login` on macOS.
- Accounts are launch-only: they don't participate in `apply` mode.

## Self-Update

aweswitch checks PyPI for newer versions in the background on each run. If an update is available, a reminder is printed to stderr after the session ends.

To update manually:

```bash
aweswitch self-update
```

To check without updating:

```bash
aweswitch self-update --check
```

To disable the background check:

```bash
export AWESWITCH_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1
```

## aweshelf Integration

[aweshelf](https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweshelf) is a session bookmark manager for Claude Code and Codex CLI. It lets you save, tag, search, and resume past coding sessions.

aweswitch integrates with aweshelf so you can bookmark a session at launch time, without a separate step:

```bash
aweswitch cc-glm -c backend -t "Fix auth bug"
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c`, `--category` | Category to tag the bookmark with (e.g. `backend`, `research`, `infra`). |
| `-t`, `--title` | Custom bookmark title. If omitted, aweshelf uses the session's first message. |

Both options require aweshelf to be installed. If aweshelf is not found, they are ignored with a warning printed to stderr. Claude Code launches normally regardless.

> **Note**: launching multiple `aweswitch -c` sessions simultaneously in the same project may result in incorrect bookmark assignment. Sequential launches are safe — as long as the previous session's JSONL file has been created before starting the next one (typically a few seconds). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#known-limitation-concurrent-launch-race-condition) for details.

### Install aweshelf

```bash
pip3 install aweshelf
```

### What aweshelf does on its own

Even without aweswitch's `-c`/`-t` flags, aweshelf is useful independently:

```bash
aweshelf bookmark               # bookmark a session interactively
aweshelf bookmark --current     # bookmark the most recent session in this project
aweshelf list                   # list all bookmarks
aweshelf search "auth"          # full-text search across bookmarks
aweshelf resume BOOKMARK_ID     # resume a saved session
aweshelf browse                 # interactive TUI browser
```

See the [aweshelf README](https://github.com/Webioinfo01/aweshelf) for full documentation.

## FAQ

### Why aweswitch, and who is it for?

`aweswitch` is for people who use AI coding agents with more than one runtime endpoint, model, or token source and want a repeatable local command instead of editing settings by hand.

- **One local config file** at `~/.config/aweswitch/config.json`
- **Named agent profiles** such as `cc-glm`, `cc-gemini`, `cc-xiaomi`, `cx-openai`, or `oc-glm`
- **Side-by-side sessions** where different terminals can launch different API/model combinations
- **Runtime-only injection** through provider-specific arguments
- **No mutation of global agent config**, so already-open agent sessions keep working with the settings they started with
- **Token references** through shell variables or `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Readable JSON** with `profiles.api` (env-based profiles) and `profiles.accounts` (official logins) grouping

### Where does aweswitch store profiles?

By default, profiles live in:

```bash
~/.config/aweswitch/config.json
```

You can override that path with `AWESWITCH_CONFIG`.

### Does aweswitch modify Claude settings?

**Launch mode** does not — it only reads the aweswitch config and passes runtime settings to the Claude Code process being launched. Already-running sessions are not affected.

**Write mode** does — `aweswitch apply <profile>` writes the profile into the agent's own config (Claude env into `~/.claude/settings.json`, Codex provider+model into `~/.codex/config.toml`, OpenCode provider+models into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`). An automatic backup is created on first write for Claude and Codex. Use `aweswitch config restore` to undo Claude changes.

### Does aweswitch support Codex?

Yes. Codex profiles use `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in their `env` block, plus an optional `OPENAI_MODEL` to choose a model at launch. aweswitch injects the base URL and model via Codex's `-c` config overrides and the API key via environment variable, so launches write nothing to `~/.codex/`. `aweswitch apply cx-glm` persists the provider and model into `~/.codex/config.toml` instead.

### Does aweswitch support OpenCode?

Yes. OpenCode profiles use `OPENCODE_BASE_URL`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, and `OPENCODE_MODEL` (or `OPENCODE_RESPONSES_MODEL`) in their `env` block (plus the optional `OPENCODE_NAME`). On launch, aweswitch writes the provider entry to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (using `{env:VAR}` syntax so the actual key is never stored on disk), then runs `opencode -m <provider>/<model>`.

The profile name (e.g. `oc-glm`) becomes the provider key in `opencode.json`. Models are specified at launch time: `aweswitch oc-glm glm-5.1`. If no model is given, the first one in the list is used. Launching only adds the launched model to `opencode.json`; after editing the config, `aweswitch apply oc-glm` upserts the provider with its full model list (`aweswitch apply --opencode` does every OpenCode profile).

Resuming a session (`-s <session-id>`) restores the model that session last used, and opencode ignores `-m` in that case — aweswitch warns when the two differ so you know to switch models inside the TUI (Tab) after it opens.

### Does aweswitch support official (OAuth) logins?

Yes — Claude Code and Codex official accounts are saved via `aweswitch account login` (or `account add` to import the current login) and launched like profiles: `aweswitch <account-name>`. Each account runs in its own config dir (`CODEX_HOME` / `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), so multiple official accounts work side by side. See [Official accounts](#official-accounts--multiple-claude-code--codex-logins).

### Does aweswitch support Hermes?

Not yet. The config format groups profiles by provider so future support can fit naturally.

## Similar Tools

### [cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch)

`cc-switch` is an adjacent Claude Code switching tool. It is useful reference material for the same problem space: making Claude Code provider/model switching easier from the command line.

The key difference is that `aweswitch` avoids global config mutation. Many switching tools work by changing the agent's shared API/model settings; that can make already-open agent sessions unreliable because the global API endpoint changed underneath them. `aweswitch` keeps profiles in its own JSON file and injects settings only when launching a new process, so each session keeps the API and model it started with.

`aweswitch` currently takes a smaller Python-package approach: local JSON profiles, runtime-only injection (Claude Code `--settings`, Codex `-c` flags and env vars), secret redaction for inspection commands, and provider grouping that leaves room for future agent support.

## Profile Rules

- Profiles live under `profiles.api.<provider>.<profileName>`; official accounts under `profiles.accounts.<provider>.<accountName>`.
- Supported providers: `claude`, `codex`, `opencode` (accounts: `claude`, `codex`).
- Profile and account names must be unique across the whole `profiles` tree and cannot reuse a top-level aweswitch command name; account names must also be a single path component.
- `env` values only apply to the launched process.
- `${VAR_NAME}` values are expanded from the current shell environment.
- `show` and `config show` redact keys matching token, key, secret, password, or auth; account credential blobs are masked entirely.

### Claude Profiles

- Pass `env` through runtime `--settings '{"env": ...}'`.
- Set the model with `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.
- Token values can also expand from `~/.claude/settings.json` when they are missing from the shell.

`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` are not configured by default. If you want Claude Code to use a lighter model for lightweight or background tasks, add `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` to the profile:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "api": {
      "claude": {
        "cc-xiaomi": {
          "env": {
            "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://token-plan-sgp.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic",
            "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "${XIAOMI_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN}",
            "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "mimo-v2.5-pro",
            "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "mimo-v2.5"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This keeps the main model on `mimo-v2.5-pro` while allowing Claude Code to use `mimo-v2.5` for lighter work.

### Codex Profiles

- Requires `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `env`.
- Optionally set `OPENAI_MODEL` (dict, list, or comma-separated string) to pick a model at launch: `aweswitch <profile> [model]`. The first entry is the default; matching is case-insensitive. Without the key, the profile only switches the API source and the first positional argument passes through to `codex` as usual.
- Base URL is injected via `-c model_providers.custom.base_url=...`, the model via `-c model=...` (no file writes).
- API key is injected via environment variable (no writes to `~/.codex/auth.json`).
- Extra arguments are passed through to the `codex` CLI.

Note that Codex has no model-tier system like Claude's OPUS/SONNET/HAIKU slots — only one model is active at a time, and `OPENAI_MODEL` selects it per launch. In practice, Codex works best with OpenAI's own models — using third-party providers as a relay is the common use case, while switching to entirely different model providers tends to give a poor experience.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "api": {
      "codex": {
        "cx-aihubmix": {
          "env": {
            "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "https://aihubmix.com/v1",
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${AIHUBMIX_OPENAI_KEY}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

aweswitch does not write to `~/.codex/`. The base URL is passed via Codex's `-c` flag and the API key via environment variable. This keeps your global Codex config untouched.

To add a Codex profile interactively:

```bash
aweswitch add
# Provider: codex
# Profile name: cx-myprovider
# OPENAI_BASE_URL: https://myprovider.com/v1
# OPENAI_API_KEY env var name: MY_PROVIDER_KEY
```

### OpenCode Profiles

- Requires `OPENCODE_BASE_URL`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, and `OPENCODE_MODEL` in `env`.
- The profile name (e.g. `oc-glm`) is used as the provider key in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.
- `OPENCODE_MODEL` supports three formats: dict, list, or comma-separated string.
- Model is specified as the first positional argument: `aweswitch oc-glm glm-5.1`. Matching is case-insensitive against both model IDs and display names (e.g. `doubao-seed-evolving` selects `Doubao-Seed-Evolving`).
- If no model is given, the first model in the list is used as default.
- Extra arguments are passed through to the `opencode` CLI.
- API key is written to `opencode.json` as `{env:VAR}` — the actual key is never stored on disk.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "api": {
      "opencode": {
        "oc-glm": {
          "env": {
            "OPENCODE_BASE_URL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4",
            "OPENCODE_API_KEY": "${GLM_ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN}",
            "OPENCODE_NAME": "Zhipu GLM",
            "OPENCODE_MODEL": {
              "glm-5.1": "GLM-5.1",
              "glm-5.2": "GLM-5.2"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`OPENCODE_MODEL` formats (optional when `OPENCODE_RESPONSES_MODEL` is set — at least one of the two is required):

| Format | Example | Model `name` in opencode.json |
|--------|---------|-------------------------------|
| Dict | `{"glm-5.1": "GLM-5.1"}` | Uses the value (`GLM-5.1`) |
| List | `["glm-5.1", "glm-5.2"]` | Uses the key (`glm-5.1`) |
| String | `"glm-5.1,glm-5.2"` | Uses the key (`glm-5.1`) |

`OPENCODE_NAME` (optional) sets the display name for the provider in `opencode.json`. Defaults to the profile name.

`OPENCODE_RESPONSES_MODEL` (optional) is a comma-separated string or list of model IDs that get a per-model Responses override (`"provider": {"npm": "@ai-sdk/openai"}` on that model entry) while the rest of the provider stays on chat (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`). It has equal standing with `OPENCODE_MODEL`: when `OPENCODE_MODEL` is omitted, this list is the profile's full model list and every model runs on the Responses API. A model may not appear in both fields — an overlap is rejected with an error. Model order — and with it the no-arg default launch model — follows `OPENCODE_MODEL` when present; responses models not in `OPENCODE_MODEL` are appended after it. Clearing the list removes the stale overrides on the next sync; a hand-set vendor npm on a model not listed here is never touched.

Launch:

```bash
aweswitch oc-glm                      # default: first model (glm-5.1)
aweswitch oc-glm glm-5.2              # specific model
aweswitch oc-glm glm-5.1 --mini       # pass extra args
```

On first launch, aweswitch writes the provider entry to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Subsequent launches reuse the existing entry and only add new models if needed.

To add an OpenCode profile interactively:

```bash
aweswitch add
# Provider: opencode
# Profile name: oc-myprovider
# OPENCODE_BASE_URL: https://myprovider.com/v1
# OPENCODE_API_KEY env var name: MY_API_KEY
# OPENCODE_MODEL: model-1,model-2
```
